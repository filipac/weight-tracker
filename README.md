- **Withings Integration**: Sync weight data from Withings smart scales and health devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Data Visualization**: Monthly weight summaries with loss calculations and trend analysis

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12
- **Frontend**: React with Inertia.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Development

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the full development environment (recommended)
composer run dev

# Or start services individually:
php artisan serve    # Laravel server
npm run dev         # Vite dev server
```

### Available Commands

**Development**
- `composer run dev` - Start full development environment (Laravel + Vite + queue worker)
- `php artisan serve` - Laravel development server only
- `npm run dev` - Vite development server for frontend assets
- `npm run build` - Build production frontend assets

**Database**
- `php artisan migrate` - Run database migrations
- `php artisan db:seed` - Seed database with test data

**Testing & Quality**
- `composer run test` - Run PHPUnit tests
- `./vendor/bin/pint` - Run Laravel Pint code formatter

**Weight Tracking Commands**
- `php artisan notes:update-weight` - Update Notes.app with current weight data
- `php artisan notes:get-weight` - Retrieve weight data from Notes.app
- `php artisan weight:generate-list` - Generate formatted weight list

## Usage

1. **Adding Weight Entries**: Use the web interface to log your weight with the current date
2. **Unit Conversion**: Enter weight in lbs or kg - the app handles conversion automatically  
3. **View History**: Browse your weight history with monthly summaries and loss calculations
4. **Notes Integration**: Your weight data automatically syncs to a "weight" note in Notes.app
5. **Withings Sync**: Connect your Withings account to automatically import weight measurements from your smart scale

## Architecture

### Backend Components
- **WeightEntry Model**: Stores weight records with validation (30-300 kg range)
- **WeightController**: Handles CRUD operations and Inertia view rendering
- **GenerateWeightListAction**: Formats weight entries with monthly summaries
- **NotesAppService**: AppleScript integration for Notes.app automation
- **Withings SDK**: Custom PHP SDK for Withings API integration (see packages/withings-sdk)

### Frontend Components  
- **WeightTracker.jsx**: Main React component with form and history display
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Modern, accessible UI components
- **Unit Conversion**: Built-in lbs â†” kg conversion (factor: 0.453592)

### Database Schema
- `weight_entries` table: `id`, `date`, `weight_kg`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- SQLite database stored at `database/database.sqlite`

## macOS Notes Integration

The app automatically maintains a "weight" note in Notes.app:
- Updates content between `== start` and `== end` markers
- Formats entries with HTML div tags for Notes.app compatibility
- Syncs whenever new weight entries are added
- Uses AppleScript for reliable Notes.app automation

## Withings Integration

The app includes a custom PHP SDK for integrating with Withings health devices and API:

### Features
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with Withings API
- Automatic weight measurement sync from Withings scales
- Support for multiple measurement types (weight, body composition, etc.)
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Withings SDK Package
The Withings SDK (`packages/withings-sdk`) is developed as part of this project and will be published separately at:
**https://github.com/filipac/withings-sdk**

This allows other PHP projects to easily integrate with Withings devices and services. The SDK provides a clean, Laravel-friendly interface for:
- User authentication and token management
- Measurement data retrieval
- Device management
- Webhook handling for real-time updates

## Configuration

### Vite Configuration
- `@` alias points to `resources/js/` directory
- Local TLS detection for `weight.test` domain
- Hot module replacement for React components

### Tailwind CSS
- Version 4 (latest) with custom configuration
- shadcn/ui components configured in `components.json`
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
