## Features

- **Weight Entry & Tracking**: Log your weight with date and automatically calculate weight loss/gain
- **Unit Conversion**: Support for both kg and lbs with automatic conversion
- **Visual History**: View your weight history with monthly summaries and progress tracking
- **macOS Notes Integration**: Automatically updates a "weight" note in Notes.app with your latest entries
- **Withings Integration**: Sync weight data from Withings smart scales and health devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface built with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- **Data Visualization**: Monthly weight summaries with loss calculations and trend analysis

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12
- **Frontend**: React with Inertia.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Platform Integration**: AppleScript (macOS Notes.app), Withings API
- **Custom Package**: Custom Withings SDK for PHP

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- Node.js 18+
- npm
- macOS (for Notes.app integration)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weight-tracker
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   ./quick-start.sh
   ```

The script will automatically:
- Check prerequisites
- Install PHP and Node.js dependencies  
- Create and configure the `.env` file
- Set up the SQLite database
- Run migrations
- Build frontend assets
- Cache configuration

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up manually or the quick-start script fails:

1. **Install PHP dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment setup**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

4. **Database setup**
   ```bash
   touch database/database.sqlite
   php artisan migrate
   ```

5. **Build frontend assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Development

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start the full development environment (recommended)
composer run dev

# Or start services individually:
php artisan serve    # Laravel server
npm run dev         # Vite dev server
```

### Available Commands

**Development**
- `composer run dev` - Start full development environment (Laravel + Vite + queue worker)
- `php artisan serve` - Laravel development server only
- `npm run dev` - Vite development server for frontend assets
- `npm run build` - Build production frontend assets

**Database**
- `php artisan migrate` - Run database migrations
- `php artisan db:seed` - Seed database with test data

**Testing & Quality**
- `composer run test` - Run PHPUnit tests
- `./vendor/bin/pint` - Run Laravel Pint code formatter

**Weight Tracking Commands**
- `php artisan notes:update-weight` - Update Notes.app with current weight data
- `php artisan notes:get-weight` - Retrieve weight data from Notes.app
- `php artisan weight:generate-list` - Generate formatted weight list

## Usage

1. **Adding Weight Entries**: Use the web interface to log your weight with the current date
2. **Unit Conversion**: Enter weight in lbs or kg - the app handles conversion automatically  
3. **View History**: Browse your weight history with monthly summaries and loss calculations
4. **Notes Integration**: Your weight data automatically syncs to a "weight" note in Notes.app
5. **Withings Sync**: Connect your Withings account to automatically import weight measurements from your smart scale

## Architecture

### Backend Components
- **WeightEntry Model**: Stores weight records with validation (30-300 kg range)
- **WeightController**: Handles CRUD operations and Inertia view rendering
- **GenerateWeightListAction**: Formats weight entries with monthly summaries
- **NotesAppService**: AppleScript integration for Notes.app automation
- **Withings SDK**: Custom PHP SDK for Withings API integration (see packages/withings-sdk)

### Frontend Components  
- **WeightTracker.jsx**: Main React component with form and history display
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Modern, accessible UI components
- **Unit Conversion**: Built-in lbs â†” kg conversion (factor: 0.453592)

### Database Schema
- `weight_entries` table: `id`, `date`, `weight_kg`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- SQLite database stored at `database/database.sqlite`

## macOS Notes Integration

The app automatically maintains a "weight" note in Notes.app:
- Updates content between `== start` and `== end` markers
- Formats entries with HTML div tags for Notes.app compatibility
- Syncs whenever new weight entries are added
- Uses AppleScript for reliable Notes.app automation

## Withings Integration (Optional)

The app includes optional integration with Withings health devices via a custom PHP SDK:

### Features
- OAuth 2.0 authentication with Withings API
- Automatic weight measurement sync from Withings scales
- Support for multiple measurement types (weight, body composition, etc.)
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Setup Withings Integration

**Note:** Withings integration is completely optional. The app works fully without it - you can manually enter weight data through the web interface.

1. **Create a Withings Developer App**
   - Visit https://developer.withings.com/dashboard/
   - Create a new application
   - Set the redirect URL to: `{APP_URL}/oauth-callback/withings` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/oauth-callback/withings`)

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Add your Withings credentials to `.env`:
     ```env
     WITHINGS_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
     WITHINGS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
     WITHINGS_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/oauth-callback/withings
     ```

3. **Initiate Login Flow**
   - Start the development server: `composer run dev`
   - Visit `{APP_URL}/w` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/w`) to begin Withings authentication
   - Complete the OAuth flow to authorize the app with your Withings account

### Withings SDK Package
The Withings SDK (`packages/withings-sdk`) is developed as part of this project and will be published separately at:
**https://github.com/filipac/withings-sdk**

This allows other PHP projects to easily integrate with Withings devices and services. The SDK provides a clean, Laravel-friendly interface for:
- User authentication and token management
- Measurement data retrieval
- Device management
- Webhook handling for real-time updates

## Configuration

### Vite Configuration
- `@` alias points to `resources/js/` directory
- Local TLS detection for `weight.test` domain
- Hot module replacement for React components

### Tailwind CSS
- Version 4 (latest) with custom configuration
- shadcn/ui components configured in `components.json`
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
